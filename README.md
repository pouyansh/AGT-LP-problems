# AGT-LP-problems
In this repository, I try to create a code of test generator and judge of a LP problem for the algorithmic game theory course.

The first problem is clear. The students should find the Nash Equilibriums of an input utility table with LP programming.
What I am trying to do in this repository is to create a code that gets the table and the output of the code of the student and check if their answer is correct or not. Also I should create a test generator for that.
